excerpt: 'As an undergraduate at Yale, I worked with Dr. Hal Blumenfeld on characterizing the neural and psychophysical responses associated with visual perception. One challenge of perceptual tasks is their frequent reliance on behavioral reports, which can conflate brain activity associated with perception with that of reporting. I led the development of a report-free experimental paradigm that relies on classification of pupillary and eye metrics to predict whether a faint stimulus has been perceived. I conducted a behavioral and pupillometry study, and my analysis of this large dataset revealed that eye metrics (pupil diameter, microsaccade and blink rate) differed as a function of behavioral report (specifically, I found pupillary dilation and saccadic suppression during perceived trials). I treated this as a training dataset for a machine learning pipeline, and developed a classifier that accurately predicted perception on a trial-by-trial basis.'

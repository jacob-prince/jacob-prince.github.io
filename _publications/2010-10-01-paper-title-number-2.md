excerpt: 'In my current role as a Research Associate with Dr. Michael Tarr at CMU, I have worked to enhance the quality of two massive fMRI datasets (BOLD5000 and NSD) measuring neural responses to rich naturalistic scenes. In close collaboration with Dr. Kendrick Kay (Univ. Minnesota), I have found that applying voxel-wise HRF optimization, data-driven denoising techniques, and ridge regression in combination can significantly improve the reliability of beta estimates within-subject, and importantly, boost representational consistency across datasets.'

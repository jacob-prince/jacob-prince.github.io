Hi, I'm Jacob! I am a prospective graduate student in comuptational cognitive neuroscience, currently studying human and machine vision in TarrLab at Carnegie Mellon University.


My current focus is on applications of deep learning and computational neuroimaging to the study of human sensation and perception. My main research questions concern how information about our sensory environment is represented in visual cortex, and I use a combination of functional MRI, neural network modeling, and behavioral experiments to gain insight into these representations.
